\usage{
gaControl(
  npopsize = 10,
  max.iter = 15,
  prob.crossover = 0.8,
  prob.mutation = 0.2,
  sig.diff = 1,
  nlocal.search = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{npopsize}{Integer. The number of individuals (chromosomes) in the
population for each generation.}

\item{max.iter}{Integer. The maximum number of generations to run the GA.}

\item{prob.crossover}{Numeric in \eqn{[0, 1]}. Probability of performing
crossover between two selected parents.}

\item{prob.mutation}{Numeric in \eqn{[0, 1]}. Probability of mutating each
bit in a chromosome.}

\item{sig.diff}{Numeric. Minimum significant fitness difference used when
ranking individuals (passed to \code{\link{rank_new}}).}

\item{nlocal.search}{Integer. Frequency (in generations) of running local
exhaustive search around the best current model.}
}
\value{
A list of GA control parameters, suitable for passing to
\code{\link{ga.operator}} via its \code{ga.control} argument.
}
\description{
Creates a list of control settings for the \code{\link{ga.operator}} function.
These settings define the size, number of generations, and probabilities
for crossover and mutation, as well as other algorithm behavior parameters.
