\title{Detect the move between two solutions}
\usage{
detect_move(prev_string, new_string)
}
\arguments{
\item{prev_string}{Numeric vector representing the current solution
(e.g., the local best).}

\item{new_string}{Numeric vector representing a candidate neighbor solution.}
}
\value{
A named list with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{element} — The variable name that was changed.
\item \code{from} — The original value in the current solution.
\item \code{to} — The new value in the neighbor solution.
}
}
\description{
Given a current solution vector and a neighbor solution vector,
this function identifies the specific move (bit change) required to
transform the current solution into the neighbor solution.
}
\examples{
prev <- c(no.cmpt = 2, eta.vc = 0, rv = 2)
new  <- c(no.cmpt = 3, eta.vc = 0, rv = 2)
detect_move(prev, new)
