\title{Detect the primary move between two model codes}
\usage{
detect_move(prev_string, new_string, original_neighbor = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{prev_string}{A named numeric vector: the starting model code.}

\item{new_string}{A named numeric vector: the validated model code.}

\item{original_neighbor}{Optional named numeric vector: the original
neighbor before validation. If provided, this is used to identify
the primary change.}
}
\value{
A list with \code{element}, \code{from}, and \code{to}
describing the primary change.
}
\description{
Compares a previous model code with a new one and identifies
the primary intended change. If an \code{original_neighbor}
is provided, this is used to determine the intended change,
ignoring any secondary modifications introduced by validation.
}
\examples{
prev <- c(no.cmpt = 2, eta.vc = 1)
orig <- c(no.cmpt = 3, eta.vc = 1)  # original neighbor
new  <- c(no.cmpt = 3, eta.vc = 0)  # validated neighbor (extra fix)
detect_move(prev, new, original_neighbor = orig)
