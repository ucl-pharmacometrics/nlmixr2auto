\title{Mutation in Genetic Algorithm}
\usage{
ga.mutation(children.cross, prob.mutation)
}
\arguments{
\item{children.cross}{A binary matrix representing the population of children chromosomes.
Rows are individuals, columns are bits (genes).}

\item{prob.mutation}{Numeric. The probability of mutation for each bit in the chromosome.}
}
\value{
A binary matrix representing the population of children chromosomes after mutation.
}
\description{
Perform a mutation operation on a binary population of chromosomes in a genetic algorithm.
Each bit in a chromosome has a probability to flip (0 → 1, 1 → 0) based on the given mutation rate.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a random population: 10 individuals, 12 bits each
children.cross <- matrix(sample(0:1, 120, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10)
prob.mutation <- 0.1
mutated_population <- ga.mutation(children.cross, prob.mutation)
print(mutated_population)
}
